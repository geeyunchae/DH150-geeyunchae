# DH150: Assignment 01 Heuristic Evaluation by GeeYun Chae


### Cooking Recipes
As the theme of the project was "middle-aged women's happiness", what first came up on my mind was cooking website or app.
During this unpleasant time, where outdoor eating is not allowed or flavorable, people often eat from home and cook for themselves.
It might be very stressful having to cook every single day either for myself and family members. 
However, now there are different cooking websites or app that can actually make cooking fun and easy. During the research,
I was able to find two resources: a website that introduces recipes and food trends, and an app that helps to do grocery shopping for you.
By enhancing the UX design, both resources can be more approachable to people of different age whether they are tech-friedndly or not.

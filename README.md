# DH150: Assignment 01 Heuristic Evaluation by GeeYun Chae


### Cooking Recipes
As the theme of the project was "middle-aged women's happiness", what first came up on my mind was cooking website or app.
During this unpleasant time, where outdoor eating is not allowed or flavorable, people often eat from home and cook for themselves.
It might be very stressful having to cook every single day either for myself and family members. 
However, now there are different cooking websites or app that can actually make cooking fun and easy. During the research,
I was able to find two resources: a website that introduces recipes and food trends, and an app that helps to do grocery shopping for you.
By enhancing the UX design, both resources can be more approachable to people of different age whether they are tech-friedndly or not.

### Severity Scale for Usability Problems
Ratings from 1~3 are used to examine the usability problems.
|Rating|Importance|
|----|-----|
|1|Cosmetic Problem.
|2|Minot Usability problem; low priority
|3|Major usability problem, important to fix; top priority|

### Heurisic Evaluation of Website - *Delish*
https://www.delish.com/
Delish is a website that provides variety of food recipes and food trends. All the dishes are provided with a video insturction of how to make them. 
Underneath the video, there are 3 section that provides the user the yields, prep time, and total time. On the upper left-hand side of the webpage, there
is a button that will lead the user to the search bar, and website categories. In the navigation bar there are 15 items: 
Meals & Cooking, Food News, Food Trends,Holidays, Kitechen Tips and Tools, Restauratns & Chefs, Entertaining & Parties, Delsih Shop, Shop Delish Essentials,
Shop Delish Ice Crea, All Videos, Newsletter, About Us, Follow, Bite Club.

### Visibility of System Status
|Rating|Evaluation|
|-----|-----|
|3| As a user click on the website, the first thing that pops up is a large banner of the food. It makes the user scroll down to access to subscription or log in button. The "Log-in" and "Subscription" button does not change color when the user clicks on it. It might be very confusing for the user to know whether they are logged in or not. 
|3| As a user clicks on the search button, it automatically leads the user in to a new black-blank page. After, user types in a word, it leads the page back in to the normal format. This can be a little time consuming and it might confuse the user when they have to search in a word. It will be better and easier to allow the user to seach up the word in the search naviagtion bar, rather than reconnecting them to a new page with different web format. 

### Match Between the System and the Real World
|Rating|Evaluation|
|----|----|
|2| On the first page of the website, there are sections that catches attention in big bold letters. The captions can be seen as fun and trendy, but it might confuse the users of the things that they are seeing. It will be better to actually categorize the caption with more direct words such as "Halloween: Pumpkin recipes".
|3| It will be easier to look through the navigation bar when the categories are more organized. Since there are cateory of "Meals & Cooking" and "Holidays", it might confuse the user and make it not effecient. It will be more eaier to be understood if the "Holiday" was in the subcategory of "Meals & Cooking", because it is a category of recipe.
